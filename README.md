# Cop or Drop

**Cop or Drop** is a sneaker collector's app designed to help enthusiasts keep track of their shoe collections. Users can log their sneakers, categorize them as a "Cop" (a must-have) or a "Drop" (a pass), and manage their inventory. The app provides a streamlined way for sneakerheads to organize their collection and wishlists in one central place.
